Transparency of energy system modelling and fruitful debates about it are very much depending on a common understanding of expressions. Therefore we started a glossary. You can watch up expressions and debate about them as well as add missing expressions at: <a href="https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Category:Glossary" target="_blank"> 
At the discussion forum of the openmod initiative you can discuss about various subjects concerning open science in energy system modelling: <a href="https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/categories" target="_blank">
